# This file holds certain properties for custom items
# Only change it if you know what you're doing

# --ITEMS--
# model_data is the CustomModalData version of this item which represents the CustomModelData number in the resource pack
# If you are using a custom resource pack, you can change this number to match

# repair_cost_multiplier = the amount that will multiply when repairing in an anvil
# -1 = does not require an anvil, can be repaired in a crafting table
# 0 = requires an anvil, but no multiplier
# >0 = requires an anvil, multiplier applied

# repair_percent = modifier for repair amount
# Value must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 = full vanilla healing)
# A 0 value means the item can not be repaired
# Minecraft formula = min( Item A uses + Item B uses + floor(Max uses / 20), Max uses)
# We take the result of that and multiply it by this percent
# Example, if joining 2 items that both have 50 durability left (with a max of 100):
# (50 + 50 + floor(100/20)) * repair_percent
# 1.0 = 100 durability on the new item
# 0.75 = 78 durability on the new item
# 0.0 = can not be repaired

# --NUTRITION--

# Nutrition values can be changed. They cannot be removed nor added to
# Deleting a value will reset to it's default value
# The values must be >= 0
